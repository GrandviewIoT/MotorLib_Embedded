# MotorLib_Embedded
Suite of code projects to provide Motor Control and MotionControl for Embedded Systems/MCUs. 

Provides libraries for Brushed DC (BDC), Stepper, and Brushless DC (BLDC/PMSM) motors, using a common higher level API. 

Includes support for Hall sensored and sensorless (BEMF) algorithms, PID for Speed Control and Torque Control,
Supports standard rotary encoders, and associated position control and motion control algorithms.
